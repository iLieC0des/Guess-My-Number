# Guess-My-Number
I've worked on my first game project using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The game is very simple, where you have to guess the correct 'Number' that the algorithm has already calculated. You get 20 chances to guess the correct number which is ( <=20) and once you've guessed the right number "voila" screen will turn Green and you've guessed the right answer.
